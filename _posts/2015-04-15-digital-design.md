<em> My 8th grade students at the International School of Amsterdam recently completed an exciting project for their IB MYP Digital Design course. For our first design challenge of the semester, students were prompted to create animated sticker packs for a specific target user at another IB school in London. I'm so proud of my students and happy to share my design tech unit, as well as student examples below.

## Getting started: How is communication changing in the digital age?

For this design tech unit plan, I prompted students to think about how communications have changed over the ages. We started our process of inquiry by discussing the first written communications in Mesopotamia via cuneiform tablets, to hieroglyphics, to Morse Code, and finally to mobile and online communications. I used the following tweet to get the kids thinking about the connection between more pictoral forms of written language and emoji and/or sticker packs used in modern day communications.

## Implementing the IB Design Cycle in this project

The IB Design Tech program utilizes the IB Design Cycle to guide all project-based learning. As you can see below, we start out researching the topic and then move on to prototyping. Next, we create the actual product and finally  evaluate the test the product for effectiveness based on the design specification.

## Researching the topic


In order to research the topic of emoticons in modern day communications, I enlisted the help of our Head Librarian <a href="https://twitter.com/michellerandis">Michelle Andis</a> who curated an amazing <a href="http://isa.nl.libguides.com/content.php?pid=652934&sid=5407276">Lib Guide </a> for my students with tons of resources on emoji research.

One particularly interesting resource from the Lib Guide is the <a href="http://www.emojitracker.com"> Real Time Emoji Tracker </a> from which many students pulled data to create charts in Google Spreadsheets that highlighted the top used emojis at a given time.

## Prototyping

In order to rapidly generate ideas for the project, students first interviewed their target users. Then, based on the information they gathered about their target users, students engaged in a '100 Ideas' brainstorming activity based on the methodology of <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/dschool/method-cards/brainstorm-rules.pdf">Stanford's dSchool </a>.

## Final Designs

Students created 8-10 stickers for their Facebook Messenger sticker packs showing a variety of different emotions.

Some students even chose to create mockups showing how their sticker packs would look if in use in Facebook Messenger. Seo Hyun even created an animated mockup, which really took the concept to the next level.
