<em>My mom is an excellent school teacher on the verge of retirement. I bought her an iPad as a Mother's Day gift in 2010 to which she sighed, "What on earth am I going to do with one of _these_ things?" Since then, her digital capabilities have drastically increased. In fact, just the other day she said, "You know, none of my friends on Facebook commented on my new pictures. I just can't believe it!" Given this example, one can see that even baby-blooming late adopters to the digital revolution inherently understand the underlying etiquette subtly present in online communications. In today's high-tech world, it is vital to maintain an online presence, and behave it a way that adds value to others, and to yourself. </em>

## Consider your online identity is an extension of your self

If you have an uncultivated, or uncouth online profile, it will reflect negatively on your personal brand. A poorly curated Instagram account shows a lack of artistic integrity. A series of irrelevant, or uninteresting status updates could lead to unfollows. Even more importantly, a crude comment, or haphazard remark can now have serious repurcussions in the digital era for your career, and personal life. Take this example from XXXXXX <insert pic of lady with horrible Africa commnet>

Therefore, consider your online identity as much _you_ as your in-person self, or maybe even moreso.  

- Personal branding allows you to manage how others perceive you

Cultivating your personal brand presence online gives you a unique advantage as opposed to in-person communications. With online profiles, you have the unique advantage of editing your content, and strategically planning your personal brand.

Your online identity is crucial not only as a job-seeker, but also for high-up managers in organizations. Believe it or not, your Twitter follower count reflects more about you than you may think You _are_ your own personal brand, and every action you take online speaks to your brand image. What social profiles do you use? What frequency of posts can your followers expect? How do you engage with your followers, and friends?

- Communicate your passions, and expertise

Blogs, and social networking sites allow you to show others what you're passionate about. Communicating in the online sphere also allows you to show your expertise in various fields. It may not be easy, but it is definitely worth it to try to climb the social ladder of the web. Go ahead and check your Klout score to see how you're doing.

- Make connections based on interest

One of the greatest advantages of social is the ability to connect with others. Sure, we're all connected to friends and family on platforms like Facebook, but are you also using Twitter, and LinkedIn on a daily basis? These platforms allow you to connect with people that you may not know in real life. Now, that might sound a bit creepy to some, but digital natives know that this is where the true gold lies. Twitter, for example, gives you the opportunity to follow thought leaders in your spheres of interest, and LinkedIn will allow you to find friends of friends who may prove pivotal in helping you to land your next big gig. 

## Online etiquette _is_ digital reciprocity

Just like the story about my mother that I shared earlier proved, it is important to reciprocate in online social spheres. Now, on the smallest scale that could mean liking a status update on Facebook, or commenting on a photo. In a larger sense it could mean reaching out to thought leaders on Twitter to interview them for blog posts, or connecting those in your network, who you know have mutual interests. By sharing your knowledge online, and helping others, you will curate your online credibility. In this way, it's a win/win/win. Digital reciprocity is the new etiquette, and if you don't learn these new rules, and implement them fast, you'll easily fall behind into a sphere of online uncouthness.
