## Computer programming skills can afford students the opportunity to access the highest paid jobs of the future

Educators have the unique opportunity to positively shift outcomes for the future job market. Of course all teachers want all of their students to pursue meaningful, exciting, and lucrative careers, but many may fail to realize just how immense the future job market in computer programming will be. The computer programming field represents an incredible market for future jobs. Why not expose your students to computer programming at a young age to ensure that they get the skills they need to meet this future demand? By preparing students to feel confident with technology and coding, we can ensure that they are ready for the growth of the future, and ready to claim those high-paying tech jobs.

As you can see in these great infographics from Code.org, there are far more jobs in computer programming than there are computer programmers. It's up to us as educators to increase this pipeline.

### People of color and women are highly underrepresented in the tech sector

However, when we look at the data of the job growth for computer science, we must also look at the current demographics of the tech sector. It is important to note that many tech companies are severely lacking in diversity.

Additionally, women are severely underrepresented in the sector, as the following graph illustrates. This data is shocking and saddening but can also steel educators to act in the interest of social justice to ensure that all students can pursue a career in computer science.

###Using this data to empower your teaching practice and your students

Although many tech companies and startups are actively working to increase the number of women and people of color in their organizations, they still have a long way to go. As educators, it is our job to ensure that all of our students feel equally empowered with technology. If you see a student on their mobile phone, don't immediately shame the student. Rather, this is a great opportunity for you to say, "You are always on that iPhone. I can really see that you love technology. Do you know how your favorite apps are made? You know that we can't text during class, but after class I'd love to show you some apps to learn coding. You would be so great at creating your own apps!" It's also incredibly important to ensure that you're giving these motivating comments equally to all students. Being aware of our own biases can enable us to act in a more objective fashion. Therefore, if you notice that you're often bragging on male students more in STEM courses, you can use this knowledge to shift your behavior to empower all students.

###Share this ultimate link directory of resources for teaching coding

Feel free to take a look at my <a href="http://learn-computer-programming.zeef.com">learning computer programming link directory</a> that catalogues various resources for kids and adults to learn to code. This is a great resource to share with students, parents and teachers.
