## Computer programming skills can afford students the opportunity to access the highest paid jobs of the future

Educators have the unique opportunity to positively shift the future outcomes for their students. Of course all teachers want for all of their students to have meaningful, exciting, and lucrative careers in the future. The computer programming field represents an incredible market for future jobs. Why not expose your students to computer programming at a young age to ensure that they get the skills they need to meet this future demand.

As you can see, there are far more jobs in computer programming than there are computer programmers. It's up to us as educators to increase this pipeline.

However, when we look at the data of the job growth for computer science, we must also look at the data of the current demographics of the tech sector. It is important to note that many tech companies are severely lacking in diversity.

Additionally, women are also underrepresented in the sector, as the following graphs illustrate.

###Using this data to empower your teaching practice and your students

Although many tech companies and startups are actively working to increase the number of women and people of color in their organizations, they still have a long way to go. But, as educators, it is our job to ensure that all of our students feel equally empowered with technology. If you see a student on their mobile phone, don't immediately shame the student. Rather, this is a great opportunity for you to say, "You are always on that iPhone. I can really see that you love technology. Do you know how your favorite apps are made? You know that we can't text during class, but after class I'd love to show you some apps to learn coding. You would be so great at creating your own apps!"

Feel free to take a look at my <a href="http://learn-computer-programming.zeef.com">learning computer programming link directory</a> that catalogues various resources for kids and adults to learn to code. This is a great resource to share with students, parents and teachers.
