<em>When my partner Richard and I joined the Kings of Code Hack Battle at the Next Web European Conference in Amsterdam last week, we knew that we wanted to make an app that would stand in stark contrast to the infamously misogynist "Tit staring app" from TechCrunch Disrupt last year. It's about time that we change the "dude" culture of programming into a progressive group that builds apps for social change.  </em>


## The Kings of Code

The Kings of Code Hack Battle at The Next Web European Conference brought together over 30 teams of programmers, and designers to "hack" for 30 hours on new and inventive ideas. The API partners for this year included Spotify, SendGrid, Deezer, Twitter, Pearson, Spotify, Mashery, Verisign, Paypal, and Push.co. We decided to use the Twitter Streaming API, as well as the Paypal API for donations.

<strong>As one of a handful of female participants, I felt even more passionate about pursuing our activist hack after being asked strangely discriminatory questions like:</strong>

-"Are you hacking?"
-"Oh, are you the designer?"
-"Are you both working on this hack together??"
-"I read your article for The Next Web Shift. Nice work. Is that how you got in here?"

Needless to say, women are still facing some serious stereotypes in the tech field, and it's really up to all of us to work to shattering those stereotypes, and showing more respect to women and minorities in general.

##Our Hack: Hashtagivist

Hashtagivist stands for "Hashtag Activist", which is inspired by the amazing work of Suey Park, and Mikki Kendall of [Hood Feminism](http://www.hoodfeminism.com)
