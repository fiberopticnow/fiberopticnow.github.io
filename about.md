###Why did you name this blog "The Fiber Optic Now"?

Yes, it's an odd choice, and no, I'm not dealing in fiber optic cables, though I do have a passion for tech. You see, when I was 16, I was a telemarketer. Pretty tedious job, yet on one particular evening I got an interesting surprise. The telemarketing software dialed a random number for me, but no one answered. Instead, I got an answering machine recording with one of the most poignant, and well-performed slam poems I've ever heard. 

Due to my remarkable memory, the only line I remember is "fiber optic now". It had something to do with the fleeting nature of reality, and the power of the moment. Unfortunately, the telemarketing software didn't allow for call-backs, so ever since I've been left with the mystery of it all. 

If you have any clues to a poem containing this phrase, please don't hesitate to reach out. Bonus points if you're the author of the poem, or the owner of the answering machine from 2003!
