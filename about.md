Hi there! I'm an American digital marketing consultant who has spent the last several years working abroad in China, Thailand and the Netherlands. I'm currently technomading, which means that I'm freelancing and traveling the world.

Most of my blog posts here relate to my work as a digital marketing teacher at the International School of Amsterdam, as well as my work as an independent marketing consultant.

I'm a pretty high-energy individual and really can't stand sitting still. I've always got my hands in a variety of projects. While in Amsterdam I started up [Coding & Cocktails](http://www.codingandcocktails.nl), which is a workshop for code newbies to build a landing page. I also organized over 30 workshops for kids in Dutch public schools with my other project <a href="https://vimeo.com/100313404">RISE OF //CODE.</a>

In my free time I enjoy doodling, interpretive dancing, and cuddling fat cats. I often miss the sound of the ocean, and can sometimes be found encouraging my workshop participants to do the wave.

###What does the term "Fiber Optic Now" mean?

Yes, it's an odd choice, and no, I'm not dealing in fiber optic cables, though I do have a passion for tech. You see, when I was 16, I was a telemarketer. It was a pretty tedious job, yet on one particular evening I got an interesting surprise. The telemarketing software dialed a random number for me, but no one answered. Instead, I got an answering machine recording with one of the most poignant, and well-performed slam poems I've ever heard.

The only line I remember is fiber optic now. It had something to do with the fleeting nature of reality, and the power of the moment. Unfortunately, the telemarketing software didn't allow for call-backs, so ever since I've been left with the mystery of it all. And no, Google searches have yet to turn anything up. Perhaps it wasn't a well-known poem, but rather the train of thought ramblings of a lyrical genius .

If you have any clues to the mystery of this phrase, please don't hesitate to reach out. Bonus points if you're the author of the poem, or the owner of the answering machine from 2003!
