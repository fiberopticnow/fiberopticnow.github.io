###What does the term "Fiber Optic Now" mean?

Yes, it's an odd choice, and no, I'm not dealing in fiber optic cables, though I do have a passion for tech. You see, when I was 16, I was a telemarketer. It was a pretty tedious job, yet on one particular evening I got an interesting surprise. The telemarketing software dialed a random number for me, but no one answered. Instead, I got an answering machine recording with one of the most poignant, and well-performed slam poems I've ever heard.

The only line I remember is "fiber optic now". It had something to do with the fleeting nature of reality, and the power of the moment. Unfortunately, the telemarketing software didn't allow for call-backs, so ever since I've been left with the mystery of it all. And no, Google searches have yet to turn anything up. Perhaps it wasn't a well-known poem, but rather the train-of-thought of the phone number's owner.

If you have any clues to the mystery of this phrase, please don't hesitate to reach out. Bonus points if you're the author of the poem, or the owner of the answering machine from 2003!
